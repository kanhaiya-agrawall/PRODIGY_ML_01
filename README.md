# Housing Price Prediction
This repository contains code for predicting housing prices using machine learning technique.

Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately predict housing prices based on various features such as location, size, number of bedrooms, etc.

# Libraries
To run the code in this repository, you'll need Python 3 and above along with the following libraries:

NumPy, 
Pandas, 
Scikit-learn, 
Matplotlib, 
Seaborn.

# Data Preprocessing

We start by reading the train and test datasets using Pandas. We then perform data preprocessing steps, including:

Handling missing values: We impute missing values for numeric features with the mean and for categorical features with the most frequent value.
Encoding categorical features: We use OneHotEncoder to encode categorical features into numerical values.
Standardizing numeric features: We standardize numeric features to ensure they have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
Dimensionality reduction: We reduce the dimensionality of the dataset using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to improve computational efficiency while preserving most of the variance in the data.

# Model Training
We train a linear regression model to predict prices from given feature input.

# Model Evaluation
We evaluate the trained model on a validation set by making predictions and calculating the mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual house prices.

# Making Predictions
We use the trained model to make predictions on the test dataset. We then convert the predictions back to the original scale and create a submission file containing the predicted house prices.

# File Organization
train.csv: Train dataset containing historical data on house prices and features.

test.csv: Test dataset containing features for which we need to predict house prices.

submission.csv: Submission file containing predicted house prices for the test dataset.
